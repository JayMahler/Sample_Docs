Writing samples

2107S09.PDF: Sample from the Steeplechase VLC User's Manual. The Steeplechase Visual Logic Controller (VLC) provided software-based, manufacturing plant floor control. I developed and maintained this document and it's related help file for over 10 years working with software development, quality control, and customer support. During manual development, I received alpha-level software and provided feedback on the user interface and bugs that I found as I used the software. Steeplechase Software was acquired by Phoenix Contact, a multi-national corporation that provides hardware-based, plant floor control. The style of this sample reflects Phoenix Contact style guide standards. 

AnnArborTopLevel.PDF: Phoenix Contact required this documentation of Steeplechase's software development procedure to conform to their ISO 9001 standards. 

api.pdf: I wrote this document for Hilgraeve, the leading developer of terminal emulation in the early days of PC use by large corporations. Hilgraeve developed and patented on-the-fly virus detection (and won a large patent infringement settlement from IBM). The process started with the developers providing me with the API code in C++. The document style and hyperlink strategy was my design. The printed version of this manual had a color cover.

Note: Microsoft distributed a free version of Hilgraeve's software (Hyperterminal) in Windows 7, 8, 10, 11, XP, and Vista. 

DynoOperations.pdf: This document provided dynamometer technicians with everything they needed to know about the controls in a new 12-bay dynamometer wing at Ford Motor Company's Scientific Research Lab. To create this document, I took a video of the subject matter expert, who provided a tour with detailed information about all the equipment in each bay and the service and use of the bays (11 were for engines only and one was for an engine with transmission). The most of the images in the document were taken from the video.

Element_ProgDevice_APP Keys Section.pdf: I wrote this document as a subcontractor. It describes software operation for parking payment and gates for lots and structures. The review comments were from the prime contractor.

Pages from win32man.pdf: This sample is from the User's Manual for Hilgraeve's flagship product, HyperAccess for Windows. I developed the style guide in conjunction with my graphic artist. All future product manuals for Hilgraeve used this style. Hilgraeve distributed this as a printed manual, which we coordinated with the printer, and electronically.
